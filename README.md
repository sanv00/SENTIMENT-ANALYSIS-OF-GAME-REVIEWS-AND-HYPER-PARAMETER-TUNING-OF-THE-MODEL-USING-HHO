## Project Description

Used Harris Hawks Optimisation for Hyper Parameter Tuning and performed Sentiment Analysis

Machine Learning models are used to perform sentiment analysis on STEAM game reviews. Neural
Networks is used be perform sentiment Analysis. Optimal Hyperparameters for training
the model are selected using the newly proposed nature inspired algorithm, Harris Hawks
Optimization Algorithm.

## What is HHO

Harris Hawks Optimization is an optimization algorithm that was inspired by the hunting behavior of Harris Hawks. It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, which means it is a high-level heuristic algorithm that is used to find good approximate solutions to optimization problems.

In the context of neural networks, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) can be used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural network in order to improve its performance. It works by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network based on the loss function, which measures how well the neural network is performing on a given task. The goal of the optimization process is to find the weights and biases that minimize the loss function and produce the most accurate predictions.

The algorithm uses a group of virtual "hawks" to search for the optimal solution. Each hawk represents a potential solution, and the optimization process involves simulating the hunting behavior of the hawks as they search for prey. The hawks communicate with each other and share information about their search progress, and the best solutions are chosen based on their performance.

Overall, Harris Hawks Optimization is a useful tool for optimizing the performance of neural networks, and it has been applied to a variety of tasks, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
